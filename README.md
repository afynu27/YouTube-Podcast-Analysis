# YouTube-Podcast-Analysis
This project analyzes YouTube podcast data to uncover engagement patterns. Using the YouTube API and Python, it performs data extraction, feature engineering, and clustering. Insights from this analysis can help content creators optimize engagement strategies for both short and long videos.

Key features of the analysis include:

Data Collection: Extracting raw data using Python and the YouTube API, focusing on videos published within 3 days to ensure consistency.

Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming the data, including feature engineering (e.g., sentiment scores, topic labels, word counts) and handling missing values and outliers.

Clustering: Applying K-Means clustering to categorize videos into high, medium, and low engagement groups based on views, likes, and comments.

Visualization: Using Tableau to create interactive dashboards that allow deeper exploration of engagement trends, post timing impacts, metadata, and more.

The project explores how factors like content type, video length, post timing, and metadata features (e.g., clickbait, sentiment) influence engagement, offering valuable insights for content optimization on YouTube.
